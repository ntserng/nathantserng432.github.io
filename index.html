        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Howdy!</strong> My name is Nathan Tserng and I’m a senior at
          <a href="https://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University</a>
          pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science and a minor in statistics. I am interested in
          pursuing a career as a software engineer post-grad and am currently
          looking for full-time software engineering opportunities after
          <em>May 2026</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the field of computer science, I am mainly interested in software, AI, and mobile devlopement.
          I love being able to create new software and using my creative mind to address problems that people may have.
          In the past, I have interned as a software engineer intern at <em>USAA</em>, where I got to work on their mobile authentication
          and security team.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of technology, I enjoy playing sports, especially pickleball
          and spikeball (<a href="https://spikeball.com/pages/spikeball-rules-how-to-play?srsltid=AfmBOoqSBCriD5BKNd8Pxt26UNc3KqELI1sDmO8GaI1z5JyQU-VAIljY">read more about spikeball</a>). I also enjoy spending time with my friends and eating lots of good food.
        </p>
